# Well Monitoring .NET Application

This project is a .NET 8 application written in C# for the Raspberry Pi 4B. It monitors a water well using a camera and display device, integrates with Azure IoT Hub, and provides remote monitoring and control for tenants via PowerApp.

## Features

- Captures images of the well pump's current display using a camera
- Uses OCR (Tesseract or Azure Cognitive Services) to extract current readings and status messages
- Calculates energy consumption (kWh) per hour, day, and month
- Detects abnormal states: 'Dry' (low current) and 'rcyc' (rapid cycling)
- Controls a relay via GPIO to cycle power when 'rcyc' is detected (with debounce)
- Sends telemetry (timestamp, current, status, energy) to Azure IoT Hub
- Receives direct method calls from PowerApp to cycle power
- Exposes device status and control endpoints for PowerApp integration
- Logs all relay actions and manual overrides

## Data Logging & Sync Strategy


See [docs/DataLoggingAndSync.md](docs/DataLoggingAndSync.md) for the full logging/sync strategy.
See [docs/DataModel.md](docs/DataModel.md) for the full data model and schema.

**Summary:**
- Log high-frequency readings locally (SQLite) for 7–30 days for detailed graphs and troubleshooting.
- Aggregate and store daily/monthly kWh summaries for long-term billing.
- Sync periodic telemetry and summaries to Azure IoT Hub, with local queuing and retry if offline.
- Use local data for graphs; use monthly summaries for billing.
- See the full document for schema, retention, and implementation notes.

## Getting Started

### 1. Raspberry Pi Setup
- Flash Raspberry Pi OS, enable SSH/Wi-Fi
- Secure SSH access (use keys, disable password login)
- Update and install dependencies (see `docs/Raspberry Pi 4 Azure IoT Setup Guide.md`)

### 2. Azure IoT Hub Registration
- Register your device in Azure IoT Hub
- Save the device connection string securely

### 3. Build and Deploy
- Build the .NET 8 application for ARM (Raspberry Pi)
- Deploy to the Pi and configure as a service if desired

### 4. PowerApp Integration
- Use Azure Functions or Logic Apps to bridge PowerApp and IoT Hub
- Expose endpoints for status and relay control

## Telemetry Message Example

```
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-10T14:00:00Z",
  "currentDrawAmps": 5.2,
  "status": "Normal",
  "energyKWh": {
    "hour": 0.52,
    "day": 3.8,
    "month": 112.4
  }
}
```

## Coding Guidelines
- C# 10+, .NET 8+
- Async/await for all I/O
- Dependency injection for services
- Use `ILogger<T>` for logging
- POCOs and DTOs for data
- Follow .NET naming conventions and best practices

## Security
- Keep your Pi and dependencies updated
- Use SSH keys, not passwords
- Never share your device connection string or private SSH key
