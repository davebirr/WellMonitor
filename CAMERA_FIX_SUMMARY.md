# Camera Property Names Fix & .env Transition Summary

## Issue Resolved ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Device twin camera properties were being ignored because of incorrect property naming.

**Root Cause**: Device twin used property names with "camera" prefix (`cameraGain`, `cameraShutterSpeedMicroseconds`) but the `CameraOptions.cs` model expected properties without the prefix (`Gain`, `ShutterSpeedMicroseconds`).

**Solution**: Updated device twin with correct property names and proper camera settings for red LED environment.

## Device Twin Update ‚úÖ

**Applied Changes**:
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "desired": {
      "Camera": {
        "Gain": 0.5,                           // Was cameraGain: 12.0 (too high)
        "ShutterSpeedMicroseconds": 5000,      // Was cameraShutterSpeedMicroseconds: 50000 (too long)
        "AutoExposure": false,                 // Was cameraAutoExposure: false
        "AutoWhiteBalance": false,             // Was cameraAutoWhiteBalance: false
        "Brightness": 30,                      // Reduced from 50
        "Contrast": 20,                        // Reduced from 40
        "DebugImagePath": "/var/lib/wellmonitor/debug_images"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Camera Optimization for Red LEDs**:
- **Gain reduced** from 12.0 ‚Üí 0.5 (96% reduction for bright LED environment)
- **Shutter speed reduced** from 50ms ‚Üí 5ms (90% reduction for faster capture)
- **Brightness reduced** from 50 ‚Üí 30 (40% reduction)
- **Contrast reduced** from 40 ‚Üí 20 (50% reduction)
- **Auto exposure/white balance disabled** for consistent LED reading

## Configuration Transition ‚úÖ

**Migrated from `secrets.json` to `.env`**:

### ‚úÖ Completed Actions:
1. **Removed** `secrets.json` from project
2. **Updated** `Program.cs` to use only environment variables and `.env` file
3. **Updated** test files to use environment variables
4. **Updated** PowerShell scripts to use `.env` file
5. **Verified** `.env` is in `.gitignore`
6. **Created** `.env` file with production connection strings

### üîê Security Benefits:
- ‚úÖ `.env` files are not committed to version control
- ‚úÖ Standard industry practice for environment-specific configuration
- ‚úÖ Better separation of configuration from code
- ‚úÖ Consistent with Raspberry Pi environment variable approach

### üìÅ Current Configuration Files:
- **Development**: `.env` file (local, not committed)
- **Production (Pi)**: `/etc/wellmonitor/environment` (environment variables)
- **Backup**: `.env.example` (template for team members)

## Expected Results üéØ

**When the Raspberry Pi comes online**:
1. **Service will receive** updated device twin configuration automatically
2. **Camera settings** will apply correct property names (Gain, ShutterSpeedMicroseconds, etc.)
3. **Debug images** should be properly exposed for red LED digits (no more white images)
4. **OCR accuracy** should improve with properly exposed LED images

## Verification Steps üìã

1. **Monitor service logs** for "Device twin configuration loaded successfully"
2. **Check debug images** in `/var/lib/wellmonitor/debug_images/` for proper exposure
3. **Verify camera settings** in logs show new values (gain=0.5, shutter=5000)
4. **Test OCR accuracy** with properly exposed LED images

## Files Modified üìù

### Core Application:
- `src/WellMonitor.Device/Program.cs` - Removed secrets.json, uses .env only
- `tests/.../DeviceTwinCameraConfigurationIntegrationTests.cs` - Updated for .env

### Scripts Created:
- `scripts/diagnostics/fix-camera-property-names.ps1` - Device twin camera fix
- `scripts/configuration/transition-to-env.ps1` - Migration tool

### Configuration:
- **Removed**: `src/WellMonitor.Device/secrets.json`
- **Active**: `.env` (with production connection strings)

## Next Actions üöÄ

1. **Monitor Pi startup** - Device should connect and receive device twin updates
2. **Check image quality** - Debug images should be properly exposed
3. **Test OCR performance** - Red LED digits should be readable
4. **Consider Azure Key Vault** - For production secret management

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Device twin updated with correct camera properties, fully migrated to .env configuration
