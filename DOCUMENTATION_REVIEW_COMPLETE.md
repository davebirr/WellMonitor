# Documentation Review and Update - Complete

## Summary

I have completed a comprehensive documentation review and update for the WellMonitor project. All documentation is now clear, well-organized, and up-to-date with the current system architecture.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Created Missing Reference Documentation
- **`docs/reference/api-reference.md`** - Complete API documentation including Azure IoT Hub integration, direct methods, telemetry, and PowerApp endpoints
- **`docs/reference/data-models.md`** - Comprehensive database schema, C# models, data flow, and retention strategies  
- **`docs/reference/hardware-specs.md`** - Detailed hardware requirements, specifications, installation guides, and troubleshooting
- **`docs/development/architecture-overview.md`** - System architecture, component descriptions, data flow, and design decisions

### ✅ Enhanced Configuration Documentation
- **Enhanced Logging Section**: Added comprehensive configuration logging and validation information to `configuration-guide.md`
- **Property Migration Guide**: Added guidance for migrating from legacy to nested device twin properties
- **Validation Rules**: Documented configuration validation rules and warning messages

### ✅ Fixed Documentation Structure Issues
- **Removed Orphaned File**: Deleted `docs/EnhancedConfigurationLogging.md` and integrated its content into the main configuration guide
- **Fixed Broken Links**: All documentation links now point to existing files
- **Consistent Structure**: All referenced files in README documents now exist

### ✅ Verified Documentation Accuracy
- **Installation Guide**: Up-to-date with current deployment scripts and security practices
- **Configuration Guide**: Reflects current device twin structure with 39+ parameters
- **Service Management**: Current systemd service operations and monitoring
- **Testing Guide**: Comprehensive testing strategy and procedures
- **Camera Setup**: Current LED optimization and hardware configuration
- **Scripts Documentation**: Organized script categories and usage examples
