üéØ Immediate Priority: Complete Core Service Implementations
1. Implement Missing Database Service Methods
The IDatabaseService interface has been updated but the implementation needs to be completed:

Read DatabaseService.cs, lines 1 to 29

2. Implement OCR Service for Text Recognition
This is critical for extracting current readings from the display:

Created IOcrService.cs

üîß Next Steps Recommendation Priority
Step 1: Complete Database Implementation (High Priority)
Implement SQLite database operations
Add proper schema creation and migrations
Implement the missing methods in DatabaseService
Step 2: Add OCR Service Integration (High Priority)
Choose between Tesseract (offline) or Azure Cognitive Services (cloud)
Implement image preprocessing for better OCR accuracy
Add OCR service to dependency injection
Step 3: Enhance Hardware Services (Medium Priority)
Complete GPIO service with actual Raspberry Pi GPIO control
Add camera service with proper image capture
Implement hardware-specific error handling
Step 4: Add Configuration Management (Medium Priority)
Create appsettings.json for non-secret configuration
Implement Azure IoT Device Twin configuration sync
Add configuration validation
Step 5: Testing and Validation (Medium Priority)
Run the application to test startup sequence
Validate all services start correctly
Test graceful shutdown behavior
üìã Specific Action Items
Immediate Actions (This Week)
Complete Database Service:

Add OCR Dependencies:

Add Missing Service Registrations:

Medium-term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
Create Database Schema
Implement OCR Processing Pipeline
Add Hardware Abstraction Layer
Create Configuration Files
Long-term Actions (Next Month)
Add Unit Tests
Implement Health Checks
Add Monitoring Dashboard
Deploy to Raspberry Pi
üéØ Best Single Next Step
I recommend starting with implementing the Database Service because:

Foundation Dependency: All other services depend on data persistence
Startup Validation: The DependencyValidationService needs database connectivity
Background Services: Monitoring and telemetry services need database operations
Quick Win: SQLite implementation is straightforward and will make the app functional
Would you like me to implement the complete SQLite database service next, or would you prefer to focus on a different aspect of the application?

üéØ Immediate Next Steps (High Priority)
1. Complete OCR Integration with Background Services
Status: OCR service is built but not integrated with monitoring Action: Connect the OCR pipeline to the monitoring service

2. Implement Device Twin Hot Configuration Updates
Status: Device twin reading works, but updates don't apply without restart Action: Add device twin change notifications

3. Test Complete Pipeline on Raspberry Pi
Priority: Critical for validating the entire system Action:

Update Pi environment variables
Test camera capture ‚Üí OCR processing ‚Üí database storage
Verify device twin configuration updates work
üöÄ Short-term Development (Next 2-3 weeks)
4. Implement Pump Status Detection Logic
Action: Add business logic to interpret OCR results

5. Implement Relay Control Logic
Action: Add automatic relay cycling for rapid cycling detection

6. Enhance Telemetry Service
Action: Send comprehensive telemetry including OCR statistics

üìä Medium-term Enhancements (Next 1-2 months)
7. Implement Data Aggregation Service
Hourly/daily/monthly energy summaries
Pump cycle counting
Performance statistics
8. Add Alert Management System
Configurable alert thresholds via device twin
Multiple notification channels
Alert suppression and escalation
9. Create PowerApp Integration
Direct method handlers for remote control
Status dashboard data
Manual relay control capability
10. Implement Advanced Image Quality Validation
Pre-OCR image quality checks
Automatic camera adjustment recommendations
Environmental condition adaptation
üè¢ Enterprise Features (Next 2-3 months)
11. Multi-Device Fleet Management
Device provisioning automation
Bulk configuration updates
Fleet-wide monitoring dashboard
12. Advanced Analytics
Predictive maintenance algorithms
Energy usage optimization
Performance trend analysis
13. Compliance & Security
Data retention policies
Audit logging
Security hardening
üí° Recommended Starting Point
Start with Step 1: Complete the OCR integration with the monitoring service. This will give you a working end-to-end pipeline that you can test and validate. Once that's working, the other features can be added incrementally.
