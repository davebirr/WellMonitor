ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priority: Complete Core Service Implementations
1. Implement Missing Database Service Methods
The IDatabaseService interface has been updated but the implementation needs to be completed:

Read DatabaseService.cs, lines 1 to 29

2. Implement OCR Service for Text Recognition
This is critical for extracting current readings from the display:

Created IOcrService.cs

ðŸ”§ Next Steps Recommendation Priority
Step 1: Complete Database Implementation (High Priority)
Implement SQLite database operations
Add proper schema creation and migrations
Implement the missing methods in DatabaseService
Step 2: Add OCR Service Integration (High Priority)
Choose between Tesseract (offline) or Azure Cognitive Services (cloud)
Implement image preprocessing for better OCR accuracy
Add OCR service to dependency injection
Step 3: Enhance Hardware Services (Medium Priority)
Complete GPIO service with actual Raspberry Pi GPIO control
Add camera service with proper image capture
Implement hardware-specific error handling
Step 4: Add Configuration Management (Medium Priority)
Create appsettings.json for non-secret configuration
Implement Azure IoT Device Twin configuration sync
Add configuration validation
Step 5: Testing and Validation (Medium Priority)
Run the application to test startup sequence
Validate all services start correctly
Test graceful shutdown behavior
ðŸ“‹ Specific Action Items
Immediate Actions (This Week)
Complete Database Service:

Add OCR Dependencies:

Add Missing Service Registrations:

Medium-term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
Create Database Schema
Implement OCR Processing Pipeline
Add Hardware Abstraction Layer
Create Configuration Files
Long-term Actions (Next Month)
Add Unit Tests
Implement Health Checks
Add Monitoring Dashboard
Deploy to Raspberry Pi
ðŸŽ¯ Best Single Next Step
I recommend starting with implementing the Database Service because:

Foundation Dependency: All other services depend on data persistence
Startup Validation: The DependencyValidationService needs database connectivity
Background Services: Monitoring and telemetry services need database operations
Quick Win: SQLite implementation is straightforward and will make the app functional
Would you like me to implement the complete SQLite database service next, or would you prefer to focus on a different aspect of the application?
