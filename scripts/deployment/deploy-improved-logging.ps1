.SYNOPSIS
    Deploy enhanced device twin configuration logging to Raspberry Pi

.DESCRIPTION
    This script builds the WellMonitor.Device project and deploys the enhanced 
    configuration logging features to the Raspberry Pi. The improvements include:
    
    - Detailed camera configuration logging with device twin vs default tracking
    - Support for nested Camera properties (Camera.Gain, etc.)
    - Backward compatibility with legacy flat properties
    - Warnings for default values and problematic settings
    - Hourly configuration summary reports

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy-improved-logging.ps1

.NOTES
    Requires SSH access to raspberrypi.local as user 'pi'
