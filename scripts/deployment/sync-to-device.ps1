.SYNOPSIS
    Deploy latest WellMonitor changes to Raspberry Pi

.DESCRIPTION
    This script pulls the latest changes on the Raspberry Pi, builds the project,
    and restarts the service. It also provides status information and monitoring commands.

.PARAMETER DeviceHost
    IP address or hostname of the Raspberry Pi (default: 192.168.7.44)

.PARAMETER DeviceUser
    SSH username for the Raspberry Pi (default: davidb)

.EXAMPLE
    .\sync-to-device.ps1
    .\sync-to-device.ps1 -DeviceHost 192.168.1.100

.NOTES
    Requires SSH access to the Raspberry Pi and git/dotnet installed on the device.
